At time of project delivery, our predictions are based on Random Forest Model. Information about decision can be found in [bilkesmodel](models/bikesmodel.ipynb).<br>
Implementation of the model can be found in [dbmodel](models/dbmodel.ipynb). Run this file to have an updated version of individual station model for predictions.<br>
